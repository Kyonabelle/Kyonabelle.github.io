<p>Annabelle pursued a technical diploma in Film, Sound & Video at Ngee Ann Polytechnic's acclaiemd School of Film & Media Studies. Being tasked with managing publicity and events for her extra-curricular clubs and societies, Annabelle's first-hand experiences helped her learn project management, sharpen her post-production editing skills and develop her unique cinematic style. On top of her excellent academic performance, Annabelle was inaugurated into <b>The Christieara Programme​​</b> in 2012 and chosen for the <b>School of Film & Media Studies Merit award</b> in 2014.</p>

<p>With strengths in post-production editing, scriptwriting and cinematography, Annabelle went on to complete internships at <b>Mediacorp Pte Ltd</b> and <b>The Moving Visuals Co</b> between 2015 and 2016. On occasion, she has been employed to cater photography and videography services at weddings, graduations, and other corporate and personal events.</p>

</ul>

<p>In 2017, Annabelle was given the opportunity to further her studies in Australia's top institution – the <a href="https://study.unimelb.edu.au/">University of Melbourne</a>. During her undergraduate studies, she engaged in academic discourses concerning new media regulations, representation of global cultures, and screen aesthetics. Offered a place in Unimelb's rigorous <a href="https://arts.unimelb.edu.au/students/undergraduate/enrich-your-bachelor-of-arts/honours">honours programme</a> in 2019, Annabelle applied interdisciplinary approaches to examine non-Western cultural imperialism in the post-television era. Using Netflix and the South Korean "Hallyu" wave as her case study, she posits Asia's exponentially increasing cultural power on the world. Her thesis titled, <i>"Netflix Unoriginals: Where does the West stand among the Rest"</i>, was awarded first-class honours.</p>

<p>Today, Annabelle continues to manage her independent videography and photography projects, and has recently ventured into producing film and television show reviews on her podcast, "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2Jobj5yU9GO76OsrQivkII?si=o0ZaXe70RImBSWiES_a5Yw">Tteok Show</a>".</p>
